# awareness
> if a character knows your there

[ AWARENESS ] is tracked as a TAG
that is used to represent
when someone knows where you are.

>you hide from one target at a time

A seeing CHARACTER gains a TAG of:
( AWARENESS : TARGET )
when two of the following are true of the TARGET.

## AWARENESS conditions

- TARGET is in sense range to CHARACTER
>see the senses page

- TARGET makes an ACTION that can be sensed by the CHARACTER
>attacking, communicating, using tools, the clap of asscheeks

- CHARACTER passes an INSPECT INSTINCT RESULT ROLL : CR of the TARGET's QUIET RESULT ROLL / a set CR
>this is for active searches, not idle ones

- CHARACTER has the [ AWARENESS : TARGET ] TAG already for the same target.
>to lose awareness from a character as a target, the above 3 cannot be true
