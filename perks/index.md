# perks
> what makes characters different

PERKS are modifiers on your CHARACTER 
that change them in some way.

PERK POINTS can buy PERKs off of the PERK TREE

ACTORs get 1 PERK POINT when they complete a STORY.

CHARACTER MAG is a measurement of PERK POINTS and increases with each STORY completed by 1 along with perk points.
> 8 at MAG 2, 9 at MAG 3, ect

## common PREREQUISITES you may see

PERKS have PREREQUISITES which need to be fullfilled before you can purchase the PERK. 

### PERK TREE PART : X
this means you have to have “X” amount of PERK POINTS spent within the respective branch, or children of the branch.
> BRANCH OF VIGOR : 5 could take 3 points from vigor, and 2 from brute

### ______ : X
this means you have to buy “X” amount of the PERK that is named
> its usually nearby the perk that references it.

## PROF of MAG X or higher
this means you have to have “X” amount of the PROF that is named
> usually prof 1, but some 2s and 3s. 4s maybe. 5s even.

## parts of the PERK TREE

PERK POINTS spent on the leafs of the tree count towards the branches and root, branch points count towards the root.
