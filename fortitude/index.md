>how characters avoid being mentally hit

FORTITUDE represents resistance to mental strain, fear, and psychological effects.
It is similar to EVASION, but applies to the mind.

FORTITUDE is calculated as:

10  
> an abstraction of a semi-difficult task using the CR chart

plus CHA BONUS  
> your base ability for defensive thought 

plus STABILITY MAG 
> your specific ability for defensive thought

plus any EFFECTORS  
> extra sprinkles
