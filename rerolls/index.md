# rerolls
> collective minimum or maximums from multiple rolls

REROLLS are the world's way of saying
"you basically got this man"
or
"nah your gonna straight whiff that thang".

REROLLS point specifically to a RESULT ROLL, POTENCY ROLL, or both of them.

## POSITIVE REROLLS

A positive REROLL means you ROLL
that many additional times,
and then take the highest option.

> 1d4 with a REROLL of +1,
> i roll 2d4 and get 1 & 4,
> i take 4 

## NEGATIVE REROLLS

A negative REROLL means you ROLL
that many additional times,
and then take the lowest option.

> 1d4 with a REROLL of −1,
> i roll 2d4 and get 1 & 4,
> i take 1
