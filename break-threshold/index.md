BREAK THRESHOLD the ruling that gets an ITEM, TILE, or CHARACTER's BODY SLOT a TAG of [ BROKEN ].

an ITEM can interpret an unstated BREAK THRESHOLD from its HARDNESS MAG, and any EFFECTORS / TAGs.
a BODY SLOT wont have a BREAK THRESHOLD unless it is stated. 
a TILE can have a BREAK THRESHOLD from its TAG, or its HARDNESS MAG.
TOOLs have higher BREAK THRESHOLDs usually from their TOOL TAG.

BREAK THRESHOLD does not directly affect outcomes,
The number of BROKEN TAGS does however.
> the object still exists, but it stops working to its full potential. see the break tag for more info.

BREAK THRESHOLD doesnt have to be HEALTH DAMAGE, it could be any CONDITION.
> like walking on a tile, getting a tile above a temparature, or blundering with a tool
