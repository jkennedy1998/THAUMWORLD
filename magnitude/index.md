# magnitude
> rolls, damage, hardness, conductivity, weight, size, temparature, speed, and time at scale

MAGNITUDE, or MAG is a representation of potency, power, and scale. 
It is used to narrate a power measurements between potions, weapons, spells and all game mechanics.
> when ballancing new game things, MAG can be thought of as a token that can purchase new abiltiies. 
> a mag 2 monster is going to have 1 more thing than a mag 1 monster 
> same with a sword, a potion, spell, monster, or anything. 

## ROLL MAGs
> the numbers
these are what the number representations of each power level are when calculating for POTENCY,or other scaling number range needs. 
> how much healing the potion does, how much damage the sword does, how good of spells can a wand cast
