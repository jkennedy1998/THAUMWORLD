> on a scale of negative 1 to infinity how alive are you?

VIGOR has a CURRENT, MAX, and MAGNITUDE.

VIGOR is your ability to regenerate HEALTH, sustain DEATH,
and push your body to its limits with certain PERKS.

the quantity of CURRENT VIGOR is spent.

the quality of a CHARACTER’s VIGOR
is their VIGOR MAG.

the MAG dictates the ROLL using the MAG DICE chart.
> the higher the MAG, the more HEALTH back

CHARACTERs can expend VIGOR to 0, but not below it.

DEATH occurs when VIGOR goes below 0.

CHARACTERs regenerate +1 VIGOR when they complete a
SLEEP or REPAIR ACTION, to a maximum of their MAX VIGOR.
