WORLD TILES are used to travel for long amounts of time.

They work off the same movement systems as TILES, but with EXTENDED ACTIONS as the timeframe.

WORLD TILES are about:
- 10,000 TILES wide  
  (SPACE TILES are 10,000 WORLD TILES)
- about 5 miles
- or 1 MAG 10 distance

###### movement on world tiles is technically much slower, but TILE movement represents moving with lots of effort at an intense pace
