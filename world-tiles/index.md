# world-tiles
> like tiles but for moving around large regions instead of tight spaces

WORLD TILES are used to travel for long amounts of time.
They work off the same movement systems as TILES, but with EXTENDED ACTIONS as the timeframe.

## what defines a WORLD TILES:
- 10,000 TILES wide  
> SPACE TILES are 10,000 WORLD TILES
- about 5 miles
- or 1 MAG 10 distance

> TILE movement represents moving with lots of effort at an intense pace, WORLD TILE movement represents moving with moderate effort at a steady pace.
