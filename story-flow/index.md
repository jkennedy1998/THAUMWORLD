> the mapping of harmony and dissonance of a story beats along a story

STORY FLOW is a map of how the STORY BEATs have the MAG of their CONTENT shifted with HARMORNY and DISSONANCE
STORY FLOW is established with the creation of a STORY

STORY FLOW can be represented by an any length list of 3 coordinates
h is HARMONY MAG, 
d is DISSONANCE MAG,
p is percentage of story complete to 100%. 
> p is for interpolating h and d across a STORY FLOW with varying amounts of STORY BEATs.
> starting beat is always 0 p, ending beat is always 100 p
> a beat that marks the halfway point of the STORY will use a the value interpolated on the STORY FLOW of p50
