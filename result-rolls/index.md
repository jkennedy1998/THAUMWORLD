# result-rolls
> how to tell the result of something

RESULT ROLLs always use a D20.
they represent a CHARACTER’s attempt at an ACTION that might fail.

> aiming and firing a bow
> climbing a slippery wall
> romancing that hot bug

RESULT ROLLs beat a CHALLENGE RATING if they are above or equal to it.
> meets it = beats it

a CHALLENGE RATING could be:
> from a standard challenge plot
> a number representing thematic difficulty
> the result roll of an opponent
> when competing with an opponent

RESULT ROLLs can have multiple CHALLENGE RATINGS.
> only attracting one guard instead of the entire room

RESULT ROLLs may have NAT RATINGS and / or BLUNDER RATINGS.
these add mechanics of extra-ordinary success or failure.

RESULT ROLL DICE:
> D20
