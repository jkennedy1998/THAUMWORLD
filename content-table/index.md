### ENEMY-CHARACTER
if an nearby NPC CHARACTER that is within 2 MAG of the ACTORS CHARACTER MAG exists, and they are not already on a STORY, 
there is a 20% chance to use them. this should be done with every possible NPC nearby that is in memory
otherwise create a new NPC CHARACTER and add them to the NPC LIST.
this ENEMY has a GOAL that may oppose yours, but doesnt neccesarily have to do with you particularly.
this ENEMY should be equal or within 2 MAG of the ACTOR's CHARACTER MAG
this ENEMY is hostile and will attempt to harm you if you get in the way of their GOAL
if the ACTORS help this ENEMY complete their goal, they may become less hostile, or even allies.

HARMONY MAG SHOP :
> wound this ENEMY from their own journey
> introduces a new flaw within their CHARACTER ( if not seen before )
> make the ENEMY have a GOAL that alligns more with the ACTORS GOAL, but they dont know the ACTORS yet

DISONANCE MAG SHOP :
> upgrade the ENEMY by 1 MAG in their CHARACTER, TOOLS, or ARMOR
> give the ENEMY a MAG 1 ALLY of their own that works with them as a friend, companion, or assistant.



### ALLY-CHARACTER
if an nearby NPC CHARACTER that is within 2 MAG of the ACTORS CHARACTER MAG exists, and they are not already on a STORY, 
there is a 20% chance to use them. this should be done with every possible NPC nearby that is in memory
otherwise create a new NPC CHARACTER and add them to the NPC LIST. 
this ALLY has a GOAL of their own that has nothing to do with yours or may intersect with it in some minor way.
the ALLY should be equal or within 2 MAG of the ACTOR's CHARACTER MAG
they are un-hostile and will assist you if you assist them, but they will not travel off the path of their own QUEST unless they have to.
if the ACTORS help the ALLY complete their GOAL, they will have another GOAL after resting or doing mundane tasks for 1d4 days. 
this ALLY could become pieces of your STORY if choose to follow nearby ( they have to get something equal out of it )
this ALLY may not be an ALLY forever.
