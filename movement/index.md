# movement
> an action type, and how you get around

Each CHARACTER has 4 MOVEMENT TYPES:
WALKING, CLIMBING, SWIMMING, and FLYING.

Each MOVEMENT TYPE allows for:
- 1 TILE of MOVEMENT in TIMED EVENTS
- or 1 WORLD TILE of MOVEMENT within ~2 hours
  ###### reminder : 1 EXTENDED ACTION is about 2 hours

When you use 1 MOVEMENT SPEED,
you deplete all others by 1,
to a minimum of 0.
###### - is less than 0

## MOVEMENT TYPES

WALKING  
###### - cant stand, 0 can stand

CLIMBING  
###### - cant climb, 0 can hold  
###### burrowing costs 4x climbing speed and accounts for HARDNESS MAG {this is a note that harness ruling is not done and will be done with the MAG TABLES entry}

SWIMMING  
###### - sinks, 0 can float

FLYING  
###### - falls, 0 can levitate

###### for a sense of scale: naked apes have 6 WALK SPEED when traveling at a reasonable pace, but all CHARACTERS can use an ACTION to refuel
