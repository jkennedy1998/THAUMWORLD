# movement
> an action type, and how you get around

Each CHARACTER has 4 MOVEMENT TYPES:
WALKING, CLIMBING, SWIMMING, and FLYING.

Each MOVEMENT TYPE allows for:
 1 TILE of MOVEMENT in TIMED EVENTS
- or 1 WORLD TILE of MOVEMENT within ~2 hours
> reminder : 1 EXTENDED ACTION is about 2 hours

When you use 1 MOVEMENT SPEED,
you deplete all others by 1 for that TURN,
to a minimum of 0.
> - is less than 0
	
> this ruling avoids people chaining movement types together

a CHARACTER can use a FULL ACTION of MOVEMENT to replenish the MOVEMEMENT SPEEDs within TIMED EVENTs

## MOVEMENT TYPES

WALKING  
> - cant stand, 0 can stand

CLIMBING  
> - cant climb, 0 can hold  
> BURROWING costs 4x CLIMBING speed and your TOOL must exceed or meet the HARDNESS of the medium you are BURROWING through

SWIMMING  
> - sinks, 0 can float

FLYING  
> - falls, 0 can levitate

> for a sense of scale: naked apes have 6 WALK SPEED when traveling at a reasonable pace, but all CHARACTERS can use an ACTION to refuel
