## TAG TABLE preface

below is a list of TAGs that are present in THAUMWORLD.
they are not the only ones that exist, but they are the default out of the box TAGs.

see the TAG page for more information on what a TAG is

If an existing TAG does not quite fit a situation,
new TAGS can be created using similar structure to existing TAGS.

> you can use the [ BALLANCE : X ] tag to shift the ballance of powerful tags up by 1. 
> this changes how tags can be ballanced during crafting, creation of new items, or weighed in ballancing systems.
