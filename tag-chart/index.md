> ammendments to rules for characters, items, tiles, and tags

## where TAGs go
TAGS are amendments to rules.
They are attached to a CHARACTER, ITEM, TILE, or another TAG.

> FIRE: characters take damage and gain a sub-action to resolve it  
> items decay and spread fire around them  
> a tile that is on fire deals area damage  
> TAGS cannot gain the FIRE TAG, as it is not a META TAG

---

## what TAGs have

### a NAME
> like FIRE!, DISEASE, or AXE

### a PROFICIENCY
> dictates what STAT or PROF is used in the TAG rules

### a MAGNITUDE 
> how many stacks of the same TAG you have per owner

### information to be tracked
> what the tag owner has to keep track of to do the ruling. this is set from the tag giver. may be a challenge rating, target, or anything really.

### META TAGs
> so less rules need to be stated over all, and so tags can be referenced catagorically

### separate listed rules for CHARACTERs, ITEMs, and TILEs.
> sometimes the rules will be left with a " - " signalling that the target type cannot be given that tag.

## TAG TABLE preface

below is a list of TAGs that are present in THAUMWORLD.
they are not the only ones that exist, but they are the default out of the box TAGs. 

If an existing TAG does not quite fit a situation,
new TAGS can be created using similar structure to existing TAGS.

> you can use the [ BALLANCE : X ] tag to shift the ballance of powerful tags up by 1. 
> this changes how tags can be ballanced during crafting, creation of new items, or weighed in ballancing systems.
