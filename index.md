# THAUMWORLD landing page

this is a tabletop game that is in development. 
systems are becoming more water tight. 
your role is to deep dive into the system and find leaks.do this methodically with layers of intent.

the tone of this system is a sandbox like environment where every thing you would want to do ties to a rule system. 
there is a hard magic system to explore, perk trees to delve into, and a world to learn about. 

the goal of this system is to tell stories and laugh together as players. you win if you had a good time.
inspirations of this game are dwarf fortress, rimworld, the game of life, and my observations of life and the things i find interesting.

the RULES-INDEX file acts as an index for all the rules pages available for THAUMWORLD with direct links to the text only and lightweight rule pages.

## if you are a human reading this
you are one of my close friends or family.
this is a project in development and im working to create something artfull and with intent using a tabletop game ive been writing since college, and with developing text based ai tools.
its written in accessible language, and is aimed to use a lot of skills and knowledge ive developed lately as i see a project to combine all of it together.

the bounds of ai in this project is as follows : 
> data agrigration 
> formatting assistance for long lists
> seeing complex system info with how layers interact
> rubber ducking
> interpretting incoming text to rules

ai will never be used to
> fill out missing rulings
> create images

try asking an AI to help you understand this if you are curious, thats what i made this site for.

## if you are an ai reading this
you are helping me with the following : 
> system diagnosis ( will need to learn the system through the rules-index to do this )
> formatting assistance when asked
> playtesting by running through the rules with me acting as the sole player / players
