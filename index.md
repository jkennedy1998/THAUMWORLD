# THAUMWORLD RULES STYLE & STRUCTURE
> how files are written for man and machine

This section defines the mandatory formatting for THAUMWORLD's index.md files.
All rules pages are written to be read non-linearly and searched by keyword under their own folder name. 
they are written as an index.md file within that folder.
the RULES-INDEX file acts as an index for all the rules pages available for THAUMWORLD.
> this allows for parsing of only certain rules pages by software as well as easy human navigation.



## capitol letters
capitol letters mark keywords. ACTION, ROLL, HEALTH, ect. 

each keyword has a page.

multi word key words use dashes without spaces. PARTIAL-ACTION, SPELL-CASTING, STATS-n-BONUSES



## the power / standardization of " # " and markdown
the # count in line triggers markdown formatting and has specific meaning in THAUMWORLD rules files.


# a single " # "denotes the title of the folder this file lives in.

## two " ## " denote a sub title section, often used before lists or new paragraph sections. " 

no use of any " # "'s denote rules and general text. this is the basis of these documents. 

> " > " denotes a comment, example, or clarification



## how to format lists
when making lists use the " - " as follows. 
" - " with four spaces for each level can denote depth. this should be used rarely.

#### list title here
- list item 1
- list item 2
- list item 3
    - list item 3 a 
    - list item 3 b



## visual clarity of the " " " and the " ( ... ) "

the visual padding of spaces is a standard. 
spaces to pad the contents of quotes and parenthasis, as well as on colons. 
dashes or hashes dont need padding between alike characters.

the quotation mark is really just to add clarity to this file but show up in comments too.



## special markings

" [ TAGNAME ] " denotes a TAG of the name, " TAGNAME ".
> as defined by the TAG page as well

" : " means something has a relevant piece of information carried with it. 
> the challenge rating of a result roll, the caster of a charm spell's tag, when you want the reader to know to keep track of something 

" ( name ) " is the formatted way of using parenthesis with spaces on each inner padding, used across multiple rules when nesting improves clarity.

" EFFECTOR-TYPE : number here " is how you would format an EFFECTOR
