# timed_events-initiative-n-turns
> how time flows in sensitive moments

TIMED EVENT, INITIATIVE, and TURNS define how time is handled 
when 1 or more CHARACTERS are in a time sensitive situation.

## TIMED EVENT
TIMED EVENTS represent when 1 or more CHARACTERS are engaged in a time sensitive matter.  
>defusing a bomb, a bar fight, stalling dialog

A TIMED EVENT ends when there are no more time sensitive ACTIONS to be made.  
>the bomb is diffused, everyone is done fighting, your done stalling

## TURN
A TURN is the time that a CHARACTER has in a battle to spend their ACTIONS and MOVEMENT.  
>snipping a wire, punching a drunk, telling a joke

Each TURN a CHARACTER will replenish all of their ACTIONS and MOVEMENT.

## SIMULTANEOUS ACTIONS
If multiple CHARACTERS have an ACTION within the same exact moment, 
>the action type  hold  may do this
the CHARACTER with the higher DEX goes first.  
>if tied it happens at the same exact time and the DM will run it

## INITIATIVE
TIMED EVENTS always start with an INITIATIVE.

INITIATIVE works like most games:

- 1d20 + DEX BONUS
- all CHARACTERS involved are sorted highest to lowest
- after a TURN, that CHARACTER goes to the end of the list and the next highest INITIATIVE’d CHARACTER goes
