> special ammendments to the rules 

## what is a tag?
TAGS are flags that signal a special rule.

A TAG may be attached to an ITEM, CHARACTER, or TILE.
If something has a TAG, it has a rule associated with it.

## where TAGs go
TAGS are amendments to rules.
They are attached to a CHARACTER, ITEM, TILE, or another TAG.
TAGs of the same type can be given multiple times. Whether the TAG rules actually use that stacking is optional.

> FIRE: characters take damage and gain a sub-action to resolve it  
> items decay and spread fire around them  
> a tile that is on fire deals area damage  
> TAGS cannot gain the FIRE TAG, as it is not a META TAG


## what TAGs have

### a NAME
> like FIRE!, DISEASE, or AXE

### a PROFICIENCY
> dictates what STAT or PROF is used in the TAG rules

### a MAGNITUDE 
> how many stacks of the same TAG you have per owner

### information to be tracked
> what the tag owner has to keep track of to do the ruling. this is set from the tag giver. may be a challenge rating, target, or anything really.

### META TAGs
> so less rules need to be stated over all, and so tags can be referenced catagorically

### separate listed rules for CHARACTERs, ITEMs, and TILEs.
> sometimes the rules will be left with a " - " signalling that the target type cannot be given that tag.
