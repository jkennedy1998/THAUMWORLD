## what is a tag?
TAGS are flags that signal a special rule

A TAG are always be attached to an ITEM, CHARACTER, TILE, or TAG.
If something has a TAG, it has an extra rule, changed rule, or added EFFECTOR.
TAGs of the same type can be given multiple times, ruling for this is determined by the TAG.

### example of a TAG, [ FIRE! ]
> FIRE: characters take damage and gain a sub-action to resolve it  
> items decay and spread fire around them  
> a tile that is on fire deals area damage  
> TAGS cannot gain the FIRE TAG, as it is not a META TAG

see the TAG TABLE for a rundown of all the available TAGs, or see the example below for how a TAG is formatted.
