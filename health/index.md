HEALTH is a representation of both biological and mechanical health.  
This means golems and biological creatures both use HEALTH as a mechanic.

HEALTH can be restored during the EXTENDED ACTION:
SLEEP or REPAIR for the cost of 1 VIGOR.

(note: SLEEP and REPAIR also produce 1 VIGOR.)

This represents an inability to heal when pushed to the limit,
and hardened creatures’ ability to push longer.

## HEALTH RECOVERY

HEALTH recovery for SLEEP and REPAIR:

VIGOR MAG ROLL  
+ CON BONUS  
+ any EFFECTORS

## HEALTH AT ZERO

When HEALTH reaches 0:
- take 1 VIGOR DAMAGE
- gain 5 stacks of the tag ( KNOCKED )

## MAX HEALTH

MAX HEALTH is always updated.

If you increase your CON BONUS:
- MAX HEALTH changes immediately
- CURRENT HEALTH does not change

HEALTH cannot exceed MAX HEALTH.

MAX HEALTH can be calculated as :
10 + ( CON BONUS ) + any EFFECTORS
