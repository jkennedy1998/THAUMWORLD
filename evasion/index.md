EVASION represents a CHARACTER’s ability to not get hit.

EVASION is calculated as:

10  
> an abstraction of a semi-difficult task using the CR chart

plus DEX BONUS  
> your base ability to evade 

plus EFFECTORS  
> extra sprinkles  

minus WEIGHT PENALTY  
> the scaled weight of gear and stability  


NAKED EVASION is EVASION without WEIGHT PENALTY.
> useful as a baseline value  
> piercing attacks may reference this
