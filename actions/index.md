# actions
> how characters do things

ACTIONS represent anything that a CHARACTER can do.
Every ACTION fits into an ACTION TYPE.
ACTION TYPES define cost, rolls, and outcomes.

Some ACTIONS have RESULT ROLLS.
> things that are easy enough to do that you wont fail at them dont need rolls

Some ACTIONS have POTENCY ROLLS.
> things that have stable outcomes dont need rolls

FULL and PARTIAL ACTIONS can be done within TIMED EVENTS each TURN.
EXTENDED ACTIONS take around 2 hours.

FULL ACTIONS use normal equations for ROLLs.
PARTIAL ACTIONS only use negative changes to ROLLs.
