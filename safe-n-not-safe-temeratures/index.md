> what happens when things get too hot or too cold

TEMPERATURE MAG describes how hot or cold something is, usually within a WORLD TILE, or TILE.
>it is defined in the MAGNITUDE TABLES

each CHARACTER has a TEMPERATURE RANGE defined by their KIND.
> a low mag for how cold, a high mag for how hot
> everytime you do something that takes awhile its a good idea to check the TEMPERATURE of your surroundings against your CHARACTER's TEMPERATURE RANGE.

## temperature tags for getting too how and too cold

TEMPERATUREs that are below a CHARACTER's low TEMPERATURE RANGE get the TAG [ HYPOTHERMIA ] 

TEMPERATUREs that are above a CHARACTER's high TEMPERATURE RANGE get the TAG [ HEATSTROKE ]

## prolonged exposure
> how long it takes for a CHARACTER to get a negative temperature TAG

DELTA represents how far outside the safe range something is.
> the higher the DELTA the more quicker the negative effects occur
