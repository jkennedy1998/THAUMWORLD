# magnitude
> seeing the universe at scale

MAGNITUDE, or MAG is a representation of potency, power, and scale. 
It is used to narrate a power measurements between potions, weapons, spells and all game mechanics.
> when ballancing new game things, MAG can be thought of as a token that can purchase new abiltiies. 
> a mag 2 monster is going to have 1 more thing than a mag 1 monster 
> same with a sword, a potion, spell, monster, or anything. 

## ROLL MAGs
> the numbers
these are what the number representations of each power level are when calculating for POTENCY,or other scaling number range needs. 
> how much healing the potion does, how much damage the sword does, how good of spells can a wand cast

## DAMAGE MAGs
> scaling damage for narration and scale sense
the effect of a MAG of damage and 
often a tell of force, effect potency, or mental damage

the actual ROLL for this damage is 
represented on the ROLL MAGs section above

MAG   description of comparable magnitudes
-2    subtle irritation, molecular manipulation, nerve stimulation
-1    flesh irritation, precision alteration, mental communication
0     flesh pain, light surface scratched, a 100% discernable feeling
1     minimal flesh damage, foliage cut, twine snapped
2     light surface damage, moderate flesh damage, firecrackers, 
3     medium surface scratched, wood chopped, light metals dented
4     medium surface damage, moderately sized fireworks 
5     organ damage from force, hard surface scratch, 1 stick dynamite
6     hard surface / light wall damage
7     light wall destruction like on wooden doors, closed windows or some weak walls
8     medium wall damage like on thin stone walls or reinforced doors
9     medium wall destruction 
10    hardened wall damage, knocking out an average unarmored naked ape

## HARDNESS MAGs
> from clouds to the hardest steels (and onward)
the effect of a MAG of damage and 
often a tell of force, effect potency, or mental damage

the actual ROLL for this damage is 
represented on the ROLL MAGs section above

MAG   description of comparable magnitudes
-2    ephemeral or naturally dissipating
-1    paper, cloth, thin leaves, non compacted snow
0     paper, cloth, thin leaves, non compacted snow
1     flesh, thick plant matter or fruit, compacted snow
2     light chitin, light leather, crumbling stones
3     hard chitin, hard leather, thorns, horns, chunky stones
4     medium surfaces, wood, bone, thin medium or light metal plate
5     hardened woods, hardened bones, intact shell, generic stone
6     hardened shells, medium metal like bronze or brass
7     hard metal like irons
8     structural stone, reinforced hard metal like thick iron walls
9     reinforced structural stone, hard metal alloy like steel
10    reinforced hard metal alloy like thick steel walls

## CONDUCTIVITY MAGs
> from dampening to full theoretical conductivity
how much THAUM can be pulled through a material at once.

dampening makes you spend that much more thaum, ( useful for armor )
conductivity allows you to cast spells through it ( useful for tools )

MAG   description of comparable magnitudes          thaum impact
-6    very porous materials                         32 extra THAUM cost
-5    soft rubbers and elastics                     16 extra THAUM cost
-4    hard rubbers                                  8 extra THAUM cost
-3    silica glass                                  4 extra THAUM cost
-2    obsidian glass                                2 extra THAUM cost
-1    metallic glass or quickly quenched metals     1 extra THAUM cost
0     amber, resin                                  not conductive
1     impure copper                                 1 THAUMPACITY
2     crystalized woods                             2 THAUMPACITY
3     slow cast metal, bone                         4 THAUMPACITY
4     pure copper, flawed gems                      8 THAUMPACITY
5     pure gold, natural gems                       16 THAUMPACITY
6     nearly flawless gems                          32 THAUMPACITY
