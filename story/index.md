# story
> has beats that happen, and a flow that controls those beats

a STORY is an abstraction of how a story is told, with different pieces within. 
the STORY is not the end of the game, but it does grant one PERK POINT to all ACTORS when it is completed.
each STORY starts on the first STORY BEAT.
> see CREATING THE STORY further towards the bottom of this page for more infromation on how to create one

a STORY should include on average, padded out between total STORY BEATS
> 30 - 50 ROLLs from the ACTORS in free time or exploration towards STORY BEATs
> 20 EXTENEDED ACTIONS to 1 WEEK of in game time passed through active events during STORY BEATs, travel or downtime.
> 6 - 10 STORY BEATS

## creating the STORY

### 1 : 
choose a STARTING and ENDING ARCHETYPE. 

### 2 : 
choose a STORY FLOW at random from the STORY FLOW TYPES

### 3 : 
choose an ARCHETYPE for each BREATHING STORY BEAT in between the STARTING and ENDING STORY BEATS

### 4 : 
spend DISSONANCE and HARMONY budget per the STORY FLOW on the STARTING and ENDING STORY BEATS

### 5
create all CHARACTERs needed

### 6:
create the STORY, filling in the details of the abstract content.
these details should be semi tailored to the ENEMY or ALLY in the STARTING STORY BEAT and their NPC CHARACTER SHEET
determine during this stage if the STORY BEAT is flagged as NECCESSARY if the ENDING STORY BEAT relies on this BREATHING STORY BEAT
determine the SUCCESS and FAILURE CONDITIONS of NECCESSARY STORY BEATs now.

### 7
run through the STORY one more time for general cohesion and good spacing between STORY BEATs
link two CONTENT TYPES with one piece of INFORMATION irrelevant to the quest
if the INFORMATION is explored, the lore should feel irrelevant to the quest signalling a wrong lead

### 8
store this STORY in memory for later use
