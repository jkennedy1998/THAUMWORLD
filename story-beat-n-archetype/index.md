a STORY BEAT is a point in a STORY where the ACTOR's movement paced by CONTENT.
STORY BEATs get their CONTENT from their ARCHETYPE of the STORY they live in
CONTENT is just what happens during one of these STORY BEATs
> see the story-beat-content page for a list of availible content to be grabbed at random
STORY BEATs have DISSONANCE MAG, and HARMONY MAG
> a budget system to add positive and negative modifiers to the CONTENT of the ARCHETYPE.
STORY BEATs have a type called an ARCHETYPE.

STORY FLOW will determine DISSONANCE and HARMONY, as well as availible ARCHETYPEs

ARCHETYPE : the type of STORY BEAT this is, defining the following
> STARTING : entry point for the ACTORs to start the quest path
> BREATHING : every point in between the STARTING and the ENDING events.
> ENDING : the goal set by the STARTING BEAT with a reward

you can find all the availible ARCHETYPEs on the ARCHETYPE TABLE, as well as the CONTENT TYPES.
