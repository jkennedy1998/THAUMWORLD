> an event that happens along a story

a STORY BEAT is a point in a STORY where the ACTOR's movement is paced by CONTENT.
a STORY BEATs ARCHETYPE has a denoted CONTENT TALBE. 
CONTENT is chosen at random from the appropriate CONTENT TABLE
> see the story-beat-content page for a list of availible content to be grabbed at random

STORY BEATs have DISSONANCE MAG, and HARMONY MAG
> a budget system to add positive and negative modifiers to the CONTENT of the STORY BEAT
STORY FLOW will determine DISSONANCE and HARMONY

STORY BEATs may be marked as NECCESSARY
A NECCESSARY STORY BEAT defines:
  SUCCESS CONDITIONS
  FAILURE CONDITIONS
  based on the CONTENT within the STORY

the ENDING STORY BEAT's CONDITION rellies on the completing the NECCESSARY STORY BEATs
> like getting the key to the dungeon door, finding a runaway animal before bringing it back, ect

if a SUCCESS CONDITION of the ENDING STORY BEAT triggers,
the STORY succeeds and all ACTORS will gain 1 PERK POINT

If a FAILURE CONDITION of the ENDING STORY BEAT triggers,
the STORY fails and is no longer tracked as a STORY, but remains in memory.
the ALLY or ENEMY will remember that if they are alive.

STORY BEATs have a type called an ARCHETYPE.
ARCHETYPE : the type of STORY BEAT this is, defining the following
> STARTING : entry point for the ACTORs to start the quest path. 
> BREATHING : every point in between the STARTING and the ENDING events.
> ENDING : a point of events wrapping up the journey. NECCESSARY

you can find all the availible ARCHETYPEs on the ARCHETYPE TABLE, as well as the CONTENT TYPES. 

## the length of a STORY BEAT
the STORY has how long the STORY should last, and how many STORY BEATs there should be.
STORY BEATS are mostly evenly distributed aloing a STORY in regards to time
> if this STORY takes around 50 EXTENDED ACTIONS to complete, 
> and there are 5 STORY BEATs, 
> each STORY BEAT should take around 10 EXTENDED ACTIONS to complete worth of travel, waiting, battling, talking, exploring, and interacting in order to keep moving forward.

## when a STORY BEAT advances
when SUCCESS CONDITIONS are met on a NECCESSARY STORY BEAT
when the ACTORS choose to move on from a non NECCESSARY STORY BEAT
ACTORS cannot move on from a STORY BEAT if they are in a TIMED EVENT or they are TRAPPED
