# tools
> items that that empower actions through tags

TOOLS are just ITEMS that have a META TAG of TOOL and can be EQUIPPED in your HANDs.
> alchemy sets, lockpicks, weapons, and even your hands.

TOOLS may list ACTION subtypes that add specific rules.
> ATTACK subtype CLEAVE: roll one RESULT roll for all targets, but with different CHALLENGE RATINGS. distribute potency rolls across multiple targets within range. 

TOOLS have REQUIREMENTS like ARMOR.
If you do not meet the REQUIREMENTS of the TOOL, the tool's MAG counts as improvised / MAG 1 and you cannot use the TOOL's ACTION subtype rulings.

TOOLS have PROFICIENCies that are stated and show what PROFS and STATs apply to the TOOL's ACTION subtype rulings.
this applies for both RESULT and POTENCY ROLLs.

TOOL WEIGHT contributes to WEIGHT PENALTY when EQUIPPED.
