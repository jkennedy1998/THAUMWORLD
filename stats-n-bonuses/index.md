> what makes a character

STATS, or STATISTICS, are the building blocks of a CHARACTER.

they define the strengths you contribute to your party, and the weaknesses that weigh you down.

a BONUS is a numeric modifier that is derrived from a STAT.
BONUSES are added to RESULT-ROLLS only.



## STAT-BONUS calculation

A STAT's BONUS increases as the STAT increases.
Every two STAT levels equal one additional BONUS.

The STAT-BONUS is calculated as:

( STAT - 50 ) / 2 , rounded down



### STAT-BONUS reference examples

- STAT 48 or 49 : -1
- STAT 50 or 51 : +0
- STAT 52 or 53 : +1
- STAT 54 or 55 : +2

This progression is linear and unbounded in both directions.



## STATS and PROFICIENCIES

Each STAT is connected to one or more PROFICIENCIES.
When resolving a ROLLS, the relevant PROFICIENCY determines which STAT BONUS is applied.

STAT BONUSes are only added when the action being taken meaningfully uses that STAT.
Not all actions apply a STAT-BONUS.



## STAT advancement

STATS may be increased slowly through the purchase of PERKS.
Characters should expect their STATS to remain close to their initial STAT array throughout play.

STATS are not intended to scale rapidly or independently of character identity.
