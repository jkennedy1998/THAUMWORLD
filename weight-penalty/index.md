> when your collective items slow you down

EQUIPTMENT WEIGHT and INVENTORY WEIGHT contribute to WEIGHT PENALTY.
> this used to be called ARMOR PENALTY insteda of WEIGHT PENALTY and is being renamed

## WEIGHT PENALTY increases by 2 ways:

### 1 per 5 lbs of EQUIPTED ITEMs
> armor and tools within body slots

### 1 per 5 lbs of WEIGHT exceeding a CHARACTER's CARRY CAPACITY within their INVENTORY
> your carry capacity is like a threshold of what you can carry in a bag without impeding movement
