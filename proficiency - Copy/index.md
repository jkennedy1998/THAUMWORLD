# proficiency
> a measurement of a characters specified knowledge or abilities 

A PROFICIENCY represents how well a CHARACTER knows a specific field, tool, or practice.

The list of starting PROFICIENCIES represents what a CHARACTER may know when entering the world.
Additional PROFICIENCIES can be learned later through play.

PROFICIENCY can be measured in MAGNITUDE.
PROF MAG represents how many times you have that PROFICIENCY.
PROF MAG scales without limit and can be negative.

> if a CHARACTER has 2 PROFS in PAIN, their PAIN MAG is 2

A PROF ROLL is the MAGNITUDE roll for that PROFICIENCY.

> if a CHARACTER has 2 PROFS in PAIN, their PAIN ROLL is 1d4

The MAGNITUDE of a PROFICIENCY determines which DICE is used as a bonus.
The more you know, the better you perform.

PROFICIENCY does not use STATS in its bonus calculation.
Each PROFICIENCY is paired with a STAT for RESULT ROLLS.
