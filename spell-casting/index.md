> how spells are executed

CAST refers to the execution of a SPELL.
Once a SPELL has been paid for in THAUM, it resolves.

SPELLS are made of GLYPHS.
SPELLS use one ACTION TYPE per CAST through ACTIVATOR GLYPHS.

SPELLS are CAST from a CONDUCTIVE tool.
The tool provides an inherited vector or TARGET.
