> the world as a grid of voxels

TILES represent a voxel of the world for the sake of
calculating movement, area, and distances
within TIMED EVENTS.

TILES are about 2.5 feet wide.

A CHARACTER is always on atleast 1 TILE in some sense.
> even if they don't occupy it

A CHARACTER OCCUPIES the amount of tiles dictated by the MAGNITUDE section for SIZE.
> they can choose which tiles they occupy, but the shapes have to be connected.

CHARACTERs cant move to TILEs that are OCCUPUIED
